# go-rancher-suse

In this script, we use Ginkgo to define a test suite called "go_rancher_suse_test". We define one test case using the ginkgo.It function that logs in to the Rancher web page.

To perform the login, we create an HTTP client using bearer token for authentication. We send a POST request to the Rancher login endpoint, passing the token as the header. We expect the response status code to be 200 OK, and we read the response body into a byte slice. Assertion is further performed on the response using gomega.

Note: Folder structure is inspired from K8s. we have a seprate runner file to control hooks like before and after etc. Test cases can be written in seprate file like login_rancher.go.
